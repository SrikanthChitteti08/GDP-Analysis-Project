# **GDP Analysis Project**
## **Overview**
This project analyzes GDP data for various countries over time, focusing on trends, growth rates, and visualizations. The analysis is performed using Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## **Features**
- **Data Loading:** Reads GDP data from a CSV file.

- **Data Analysis:** Calculates GDP growth rates for each country.

- **Visualization:** Creates interactive line plots to visualize GDP trends over time.

- **Comparative Analysis:** Ranks countries based on average GDP growth rates.

## **Key Insights**
- **GDP Growth Calculation:** The project computes the year-over-year percentage change in GDP for each country.

- **Top Performers:** Identifies countries with the highest average GDP growth rates (e.g., Cayman Islands, Equatorial Guinea).

- **Interactive Plots:** Uses Plotly to generate interactive visualizations for GDP trends of specific countries (e.g., World, India, Italy).

## **Tools Used**
### **Python Libraries:**

- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.

- **NumPy:** Numerical computations.

- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Basic plotting.

- **Plotly:** Interactive visualizations.

- **Jupyter Notebook:** For code execution and documentation.

## **How to Use**
- **Clone the Repository:**

    
    
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd gdp-analysis
    Install Dependencies:

    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
    Run the Notebook:
    Open Quiz.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to perform the analysis.

## **Results**
- **Visualizations:** Interactive plots are saved as HTML files (e.g., World GDP.html, India GDP.html).

- **Data Output:** The processed data includes GDP growth rates for each country and year.

## **Example Visualizations**
- **World GDP Analysis:** Shows the global GDP trend from 1960 to 2016.

- **Country-Specific Analysis:** Detailed GDP trends for countries like India and Italy.

- Future Work
- Expand the dataset to include more recent years.

- Add more advanced statistical analyses (e.g., GDP correlations with other economic indicators).

- Enhance visualizations with additional interactive features.
## **Conclusion**
The GDP Analysis Project provides a comprehensive exploration of global GDP trends, focusing on year-over-year growth rates and comparative performance across countries. By leveraging Python's powerful data analysis and visualization libraries, the project offers valuable insights into economic trends over several decades.
